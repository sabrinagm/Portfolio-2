# Portfolio-2
 Portfolio 2 DIG 4639

For Portfolio 2, I have modified the ToDo App project we previously created and modified it to be a study manager.

The first new component I created was the Login function, which allows the user to log in only if the password is correct. If the password is incorrect, an error appears. If it is correct, the app welcomes you to the ToDo app.

The second component I have created is a NewUser function, which allows new users to fill out a form on the login page. 

The third component I have included is an Important Dates functions which, after logging in, allows the user to click a button and see upcoming important dates.
